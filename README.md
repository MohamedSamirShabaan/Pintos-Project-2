# Pintos-Project-2
Multiprogramming

 Now that you've worked with Pintos and are becoming familiar with its infrastructure and thread package, it's time to start working on the parts of the system that allow running user programs. The base code already supports loading and running user programs, but no I/O or interactivity is possible. In this project, you will enable programs to interact with the OS via system calls.

You will be working out of the "userprog" directory for this assignment, but you will also be interacting with almost every other part of Pintos. We will describe the relevant parts below.
